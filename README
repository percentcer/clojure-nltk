# clojure-nltk

Most of the functionality in the Python-based Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
works in Jython (it has a few dependencies only available in CPython).  However
with some minor tweaks it is possible to use a sizable subset of NLTK in Jython,
and by extension, in Clojure.

## Usage

(ns clojure-nltk.core
  (:require [clojure-nltk.core :as nltk]))

(nltk/nltk-init) ; initialize nltk

## Installation

To include as a dependency:

Copy the config section found at http://clojars.org/clojure-nltk into your
dependencies in your project's project.clj.
